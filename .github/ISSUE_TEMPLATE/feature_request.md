**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Loco scroll could take over the world if there was an option to not only translate but roate and scale also with scroll.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
This type of effect can be achieved with https://github.com/alexcambose/motus
But the problem is it only works when native scroll is enabled, and is not as smooth.
It does not work with loco scroll.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.
